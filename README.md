# Personal-Reading-List
I've decided keep track of the resources I found really useful.

Basic writing and formatting syntax: https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/
  - Summary: I included this link so I could always have a solid quick reference for creating this running document.
  
March 2018:

1) The Complexity of Public-Key Cryptography: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/365.pdf
  - Summary: TBA 
  
2) Truthcoin : http://bitcoinhivemind.com/papers/truthcoin-whitepaper.pdf
  - Summary: TBA
  
3) New Directions in Cryptography : https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf
  - Summary: In an authentication system, cryptography is used to guarantee the authenticity of the message to the receiver. Not only must a meddler be prevented from injecting totally new, authentic looking messages into a channel, but he must be prevented from creating apparently authentic messages by combining, or merely repeating, old messages which he has copied in the past. A cryptographic system intended to guarantee privacy will not, in general, prevent this latter form of mischief. 

4) Lectures on Discrete Probabilistic Models: http://www.math.unipd.it/~pavon/Site/Teaching_files/notes.pdf
  - Summary: (This document will take me sometime to read, but I will hopefully have a rough understanding of the material before the summer)
