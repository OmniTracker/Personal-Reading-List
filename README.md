I've decided keep track of the resources I found really useful.

  - Summary: I included this link so I could always have a solid quick reference for creating this running document.
  
March 2018:

  - Summary: TBA
  
4) New Directions in Cryptography : https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf
  - Summary: In an authentication system, cryptography is used to guarantee the authenticity of the message to the receiver. Not only must a meddler be prevented from injecting totally new, authentic looking messages into a channel, but he must be prevented from creating apparently authentic messages by combining, or merely repeating, old messages which he has copied in the past. A cryptographic system intended to guarantee privacy will not, in general, prevent this latter form of mischief. 
  - The first step in assessing the adequacy of cryptographic systems is to classify the threats to which they are to be subjected. The following threats may occur to cryptographic systems employed for either privacy or authentication.
    - A ciphertext only attack is a cryptanalytic attack in which the cryptanalyst possesses only ciphertext.
    - A known plaintext attack is a cryptanalytic attack in which the cryptanalyst possesses a substantial quantity of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext.
    - A chosen plaintext attack is a cryptanalytic attack in which the cryptanalyst can submit an unlimited number of plaintext messages of his own choosing and examine the resulting cryptograms.

5) Merkle Signature Schemes, Merkle Trees and Their Cryptanalysis: https://www.emsec.rub.de/media/crypto/attachments/files/2011/04/becker_1.pdf
  - Summary:

6) Lectures on Discrete Probabilistic Models: http://www.math.unipd.it/~pavon/Site/Teaching_files/notes.pdf
  - Summary: (This document will take me sometime to read, but I will hopefully have a rough understanding of the material before the summer)
  
 7) Proof-of-work system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system
  - Summary: An economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. This is just a wikipedia page I found interesting.
    - HashCash: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash
