4) New Directions in Cryptography : https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf
  - Summary: In an authentication system, cryptography is used to guarantee the authenticity of the message to the receiver. Not only must a meddler be prevented from injecting totally new, authentic looking messages into a channel, but he must be prevented from creating apparently authentic messages by combining, or merely repeating, old messages which he has copied in the past. A cryptographic system intended to guarantee privacy will not, in general, prevent this latter form of mischief. 
  - The first step in assessing the adequacy of cryptographic systems is to classify the threats to which they are to be subjected. The following threats may occur to cryptographic systems employed for either privacy or authentication.
    - A ciphertext only attack is a cryptanalytic attack in which the cryptanalyst possesses only ciphertext.
    - A known plaintext attack is a cryptanalytic attack in which the cryptanalyst possesses a substantial quantity of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext.
    - A chosen plaintext attack is a cryptanalytic attack in which the cryptanalyst can submit an unlimited number of plaintext messages of his own choosing and examine the resulting cryptograms.

 7) Proof-of-work system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system
  - Summary: An economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. This is just a wikipedia page I found interesting.

  8) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791#section-1.1
    - This document specifies the DoD Standard Internet Protocol.  This document is based on six earlier editions of the ARPA Internet Protocol Specification, and the present text draws heavily from them.  There have been many contributors to this work both in terms of concepts and in terms of text.  This edition revises aspects of addressing, error handling, option codes, and the security, precedence, compartments, and handling restriction features of the internet protocol.
    
  9) https://interledger.org/interledger.pdf
    -  Digital payment systems use ledgers to track accounts and balances and to enable local transfers between their users. Today, there are few connectors facilitating payments between these ledgers and there are high barriers to entry for creating new connections. Connectors are not standardized and they must be trusted not to steal the sender’s money.
      
  10) https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf
    - The bitcoin protocol can encompass the global financial transaction volume in all electronic payment systems today, without a single custodial third party holding funds or requiring participants to have anything more than a computer using a broadband connection. A decentralized system is proposed whereby transactions are sent over a network of micropayment channels (a.k.a. payment channels or transaction channels) whose transfer of value occurs off-blockchain. If Bitcoin transactions can be signed with a new sighash type that addresses malleability, these transfers may occur between untrusted parties along the transfer route by contracts which, in the event of uncooperative or hostile participants, are enforceable via broadcast over the bitcoin blockchain in the event of uncooperative or hostile participants, through a series of decrementing timelocks.

    - A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution

    - Effort has been directed towards architecting a parallel financial system with bitcoin the currency as a base layer. The driving force are flexibility benefits of cryptographic ledgers enabling new use cases like Multi-signature accounts, Decentralized exchange, Machine to machine transactions etc. This paper analyzes applications of cryptographic ledgers in the current financial system and aims to stimulate the discussion.

        - Mutual distributed ledgers (aka blockchains) record transactions and ownership using pervasive, persistent, and permanent data structures replicated across numerous computers. The two principal technology components are public-key cryptography and ‘peer-to-peer’ or shared data storage. The end result is a data source that is simultaneously logically ‘central’ while technically ‘distributed’ across the computers on the network.

        - Crypto-currency is a form of decentralized digital currency that has changed the world of finance over the past several years. Bitcoin[6] lacks a central authority and protects anonymity, while allowing a relatively low-cost alternative to fiat. It opens the doors for international exchange of commoditie  and has the potential to change how business is conducted. The signature and scripting system that Bitcoin uses allows for the creation of smart contracts. Also using signatures, it is possible to create accounts that require multiple signatures (multisig accounts) as well as transactions with multiple inputs and outputs. There has been discussion of some of the current weaknesses with smart contracts. We address these weaknesses to make smart contracts immediately accessible on the Bitcoin network. As proposed, this protocol offers a system of commitment schemes and business protocols that greatly reduces the issues of extortion and malleability from two-party escrow.

    - When we currently use a smart phone or a laptop on a cell network or the Internet, the other end of these interactions typically run on other solo computers, such as web servers. Practically all of these machines have architectures that were designed to be controlled by a single person or a hierarchy of people who know and trust each other.
